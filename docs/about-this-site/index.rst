Technical details
-----------------

This documentation is automatically generated by the Sphinx build system.  It
is readable as either browseable HTML (generally known as a "website") or one
big PDF document.

The source"code" is hosted on GitHub, and the website (what you're *probably*
reading right now) is hosted by ReadTheDocs Community.  With the magic of
webhooks, any changes to the master branch on the GitHub repository should
automatically be built and published on the website quite quickly (sub-15min,
if all goes well).
