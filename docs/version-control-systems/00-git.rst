Git
===

Git is one of the most popular version control systems today.  It is known as a
"distributed version control system" (DVCS), for supporting many developers
working on a project at once in an asynchronus manner.

.. seealso::

   There is a plethora of existing documentation for Git:

   * The `Git Book <https://git-scm.com/>`_ is the official bible of Git
   * A previous UND student has given a ~1hr "git for dummies" talk, with a
     recording and slides posted `here <https://turnbull.link/acm/git>`_.
     (disclaimer: I'm the person who wrote that git talk, and is currently
     writing this page :)
   * Current estimates indicate approximately 1 in 3 questions on StackOverflow
     is related to Git (/s).  If you have a problem, Google can help.
