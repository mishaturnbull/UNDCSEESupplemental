Programming languages
=====================

A programming language is a specific set of syntax rules and semantics that
allow a programmer to issue instructions to a computer.

There are two main categories of languages:

* Imperative: the programmer issues step-by-step instructions for the computer
  to take

  * This includes, notably Python, Java, the C family, and many more

* Declarative: the programmer describes the end goal, and the computer figures
  out how to get there

  * Many "markup" languages fall into this category, such as Markdown, HTML,
    and LaTeX

   definitions?  may be backwards)
