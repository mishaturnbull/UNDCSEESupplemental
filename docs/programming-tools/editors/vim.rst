Vim
===

Vim, short for Vi iMproved, is a command-line editor and (arguably) development
environment.  It was designed for the Unix / Linux operating system family, but
can also be installed on Windows and MacOS.  Because it is entirely a
command-line tool, it can be operated over an SSH / RSH / telnet session quite
easily.  It is free (as in beer, and freedom) and open-source.

Vim is known for having a steep learning curve, but once you reach the top of
that curve, it can be a very efficient and fast editor.
