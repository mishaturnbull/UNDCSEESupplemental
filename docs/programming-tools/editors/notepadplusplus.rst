Notepad++
=========

Notepad++ is a free and open-source source code editor for the Windows
operating system.  It is designed as an upgrade and replacement for the
built-in :ref:`Windows Notepad <topics/prog-tools/editors/notepad>`.  It is
free (as in beer, and freedom) and open-source.

   * `The official Notepad++ website <https://notepad-plus-plus.org/>`_

Notepad++ features:

* Syntax highlighting (for just about any language you can think of)
* Dark mode
* Line numbering
* Find-in-files
* Autocompletion
* User-recorded macros for automation
* Plugin system

and many more.

It does *not* feature (it does not claim to be a full IDE):

* Compiler(s)
* Debugger(s)
* Remote target editing

though, with the plugin system and ability to call external commands, many of
these can indeed be automated.
