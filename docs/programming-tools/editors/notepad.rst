Notepad
=======

Notepad is a plain-text file editor built into the Windows operating system.
It is generally considered one of the most feature-less editors.  As a
standalone application, it is free (as in beer, but not freedom), but not
open-source (though, the operating system required to run it is NOT free nor
open source).

     replacement for Notepad designed for sourcecode editing

Notepad does **NOT** have any of the following:

* Syntax highlighting
* Find-in-files
* Line numbering

     At least, on windows 10.  On the win 11 app, it *may* have line numbering?
     If someone has windows 11 handy, please confirm or deny.  I don't.)
