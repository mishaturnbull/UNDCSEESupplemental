Spyder
======

Spyder, or Scientific PYthon Development Environment and Runtime, is an
integrated development environment oriented at the Python programming langauge.
It is distributed as a Python module, which can be installed via Pip.  It is
also available via conda / anaconda.  Because it is implemented in Python, it
can be used on Windows, Mac, and Linux platforms (anywhere Python can run,
Spyder can run).  It is free (as in beer, and freedom) and open-source.
