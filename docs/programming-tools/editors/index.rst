Editors
=======

An editor is a program that allows you to edit files.

Though there are *many*, in this context, I'll focus on editors meant for (or
commonly used in) programming.  There are two primary "kinds" of editors --
regular old editors, and Integrated Development Environments (IDEs).  Regular
editors typically only perform file content updates, while IDEs are often
centered around a given language (sometimes a family of languages) and
incorporate compilers, debuggers, syntax highlighting, and many more features.
Both are discussed here.
