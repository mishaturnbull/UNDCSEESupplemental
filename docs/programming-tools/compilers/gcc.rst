GNU C Compiler (GCC)
====================

The GNU C Compiler (GCC) is a compiler for multiple languages, including the C
family, Ada, and more.  It is part of the GNU tools suite, and often included
on Linux/Unix systems out of the box; for this reason, it is one of the more
commonly-used compilers in these environments.
