GNU C Compiler (GCC)
====================

The GNU C Compiler (GCC) is a compiler for multiple languages, including the C
family (but not C#), Fortran, Ada, Go, and more.  It is part of the GNU tools
suite, and often included on Linux/Unix systems out of the box; for this
reason, it is one of the more commonly-used compilers in these environments.
