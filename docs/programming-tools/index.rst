Programming tools
=================

This section covers tools for programming in various languages; editors,
compilers, debuggers, etc..

Bias warning: the author of this page generally prefers to work in Linux
command-line environments, and either pure C or Python.  Until someone else
comes along, that's probably all that'll be covered here.  Enjoy!
