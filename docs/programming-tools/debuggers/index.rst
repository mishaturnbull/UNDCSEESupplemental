Debuggers
=========

Debuggers are tools that help actively find bugs / troubleshoot your code.
They are often tied closely to your language or compiler.  Debuggers are *not*
"adding a bunch of ``print()`` calls to your code," nor are they "use the
logging module."  A debugger is an active, standalone tool that can
"introspect" your code -- you can pause execution, inspect variables, and more.
